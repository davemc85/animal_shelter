BRIEF

Animal Shelter
The Scottish Animal Shelter accepts orphaned or stray animals and takes care of them until
they can be adopted by a new owner. The shelter has a list of potential new owners for the
animals. Animals may take a while to be trained up and made healthy before being available
for adoption.

They are looking for a management system to keep track of their animals and owners.
